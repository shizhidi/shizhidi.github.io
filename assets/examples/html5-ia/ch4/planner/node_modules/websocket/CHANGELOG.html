<h1 id="Changelog">Changelog</h1><p>I decided it’s time to start maintaining a changelog now, starting with version 1.0.1.</p>
<h2 id="Version_1-0-1">Version 1.0.1</h2><p><em>Released 2011-11-21</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Now works with Node 0.6.2 as well as 0.4.12</li>
<li>Support TLS in WebSocketClient</li>
<li>Added support for setting and reading cookies</li>
<li>Added WebSocketServer.prototype.broadcast(data) convenience method</li>
<li>Added <code>resourceURL</code> property to WebSocketRequest objects.  It is a Node URL object with the <code>resource</code> and any query string params already parsed.</li>
<li>The WebSocket request router no longer includes the entire query string when trying to match the path name of the request.</li>
<li>WebSocketRouterRequest objects now include all the properties and events of WebSocketRequest objects.</li>
<li>Removed more console.log statements.  Please rely on the various events emitted to be notified of error conditions.  I decided that it is not a library’s place to spew information to the console.</li>
<li>Renamed the <code>websocketVersion</code> property to <code>webSocketVersion</code> throughout the code to fix inconsistent capitalization.  <code>websocketVersion</code> has been kept for compatibility but is deprecated and may be removed in the future.</li>
<li>Now outputting the sanitized version of custom header names rather than the raw value.  This prevents invalid HTTP from being put onto the wire if given an illegal header name.</li>
</ul>
